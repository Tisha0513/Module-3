                    <h4 id="list-item-1">Swimming</h4>
                    <p>TSwimming was first introduced at the Olympics in 1896. The first known record of people swimming dates back to Egyptian
                    drawings from 2500 BC, with stone age paintings in the Cave of Swimmers dating back even further</p>
                    <h4 id="list-item-2">Piano</h4>
                    <p>The piano is considered both a string and percussion instrument because it produces sound by striking strings with
                    hammers. There are 18 million non-professional piano players in the U.S. alone. A typical piano has about 12,000 parts,
                    10,000 of which are moving.</p>
                    <h4 id="list-item-3">Guitar</h4>
                    <p>The neck of the guitar has many lines on it called frets. They change the pitch of the string like keys on a piano. It
                    was in the late-1800s that the modern classical guitar was developed.</p>

                    You will be surprised to know that the shuttlecock is made up of the left wing of the goose. The average weight of the
                    shuttlecock is between 4.74 and 5.55 gms. Sixteen feathers are used in the manufacture of the shuttle; during a
                    top-level match, ten shuttles are used with which each is being hit at least 400 times.</p>
