            <h2>Piano</h2>
            <p>Even though youâ€™re sitting down, playing the piano is a workout all its own, and offers different physical and
            physiological advantages to players of all ages. For instance, regular piano playing sharpens fine motor skills and
            improves hand-eye coordination in the young and developing. Research has shown that piano lessons for older adults have
            a significant impact on increased levels of Human Growth Hormone, which slows the adverse effects of aging. Bringing
            music into your life is also proven to reduce anxiety, heart and respiratory rates, cardiac complications, and to lower
            blood pressure and increase immune response.</p>
